RECIPE OF THE DAY
Cherry Pancakes for One

INGREDIENTS
1. plain greek yogurt
1/4-cup greek yogurt, non fat , plain
2. egg whites
1 egg whites
3. almond extract
1/2-tsp almond extract
4. whole-wheat pastry flour
3 Tbsp. whole-wheat pastry flour
5. baking soda
1/4-tsp baking soda
6. sugar
1/4 tsp sugar
7. salt
Dash of Salt
8. cherries
1/3 cup whole cherries, pitted, cut in half or in quarters depending on size of cherries
9. cherries
1/2 cups cherries, pitted, cut in half
10. pancake syrup
1/4 cup pancake syrup (I used Mrs. Butterworths sugar free syrup)


INSTRUCTIONS
Mix greek yogurt, egg white & almond extract into a small bowl
In a separate bowl combine flour, baking soda, sugar, & salt
Combine and whisk till evenly mixed
Fold in 1/3 cup cherries
Place 1/4-cup batter onto non-stick skillet and cook till bubbles start appearing through the top of the pancake and then flip. NOTE: Cook on medium heat and I flattened out my batter with the spatula to cook more evenly.
About 1-2 minutes on each side
For sauce:
In a sauce pan add 1/2 cup whole pitted cherries and maple syrup. Set temperature on medium, and when it starts to simmer, set the temperature to low and cook until thick and bubbly. Its done about the same time your pancakes are.
